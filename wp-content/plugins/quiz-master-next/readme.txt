We have begun creating documentation for the plugin.

Yes, it is possible to edit the output of the variable %QUESTIONS_ANSWERS%. When editing your quiz, go to the “Text” tab. Once on the “Text” tab scroll almost all the way down the page and you will see a text area that allows you to edit the contents of %QUESTIONS_ANSWERS%.

= I want to remove the "Correct Answer" part of my results page, or I want to display the "Correct Answer Info" part on my results page. How can I do that? =

To make these changes, you will edit the %QUESTIONS_ANSWERS% variable. To do that, simply look at the answer to the previous question.
